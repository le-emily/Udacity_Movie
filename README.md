# Udacity-FullStack
To run this program and see a list of Pooglia's favorite movies:

Make sure Python is installed

Open up your terminal and run:

$ python

It should return some version of Python 2.7. If you are running Python 3.0, you will need to run some sort of virtual environment: http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/

If Python is not installed at all, see the documentation here: https://www.python.org

# Clone the Repository

Once you are sure Python 2.7 is installed correctly execute the following:

$ git clone https://github.com/p00gz/udacity-movie-trailer-website.git
$ cd udacity-movie-trailer-website

# Execute the program:

$ python entertainment.py

A browser should open on your local machine and and render the HTML template with Pooglia's favorite movies. Click on a movie thumbnail to view the trailer!
